        <p>As a Creative Producer, I manage software development projects, UX design projects, and branding engagements from start to finish. My job entails obsessing over all of the non-digital interactions our clients have with us. This work entails moving toward consistency, clarity, and candor in every meeting, every email, every phone call, and every human to human interaction.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I manage software development projects, UX design projects, and branding engagements from start to finish. I work to facilitate meetings with clients as well as our internal teams while also working to make sure projects are complete on time and within budget. I have worked on and led successful projects with more than 18 different companies, ranging in duration from 2 weeks to 6 months, with budgets ranging from $30K - $500K. We work hard and fast at Human Design to bring the best product forward to our clients.</p>
        <p>My work at <a href="http://humandesign.com/" target="_blank">Human Design</a> as a Creative Producer started my passion for web-development. I get to work with some fantastic designers and developers every day and now I am working to be the best web-developer I can be.</p>
